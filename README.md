# personal blog
As per mentioned in the title, this repository will be my personal blog/web/portfolio. I know I am a bit late to this (considering the repo is made during about halfway more of my graduation), but I hope it could be a sufficient representation of me. Later in the web, no fancy design or interfaces will be implemented. Not because I do no want to, but more of that I do not have the skillset to do so. Anyways, the purpose of the blog (besides to showcase fancy coding projects for graduate jobs), but to also document my learning as a computer science student. I hope the blog could help on the things I am currently interested in or the things I am currently studying.
